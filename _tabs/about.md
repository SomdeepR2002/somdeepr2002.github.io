Iâ€™m **rayxcyber** â€” doing a little bit of everything in cybersecurity until I *accidentally specialize* in something. <br>

This blog is where I document my adventures (and misadventures) across the cyber landscape. Youâ€™ll find a mix of:
- **CTF & challenge writeups** â€” explained clearly, even if they werenâ€™t solved cleanly
- **Side projects & scripts** â€” half learning tools, half duct tape
- **Breakdowns of what Iâ€™m learning** â€” because if I donâ€™t write it down, I will absolutely forget it

I started this blog to track my progress, share insights, and turn confusion into documentation â€” for me, and maybe for you too.

I enjoy:
- Reading logs until something blinks wrong 
- Reversing binaries to figure out what theyâ€™re hiding
- Solving weird technical puzzles that feel more like side quests

If youâ€™re in cybersecurity and somehow ended up here:
- Yes, I can write proper documentation
- No, I donâ€™t talk like this in interviews.
- And yes, Iâ€™m serious about getting better at this *every day*


ðŸ“š Feel free to explore, learn, or judge my notes â€” theyâ€™re mostly here so future-me doesnâ€™t suffer.
